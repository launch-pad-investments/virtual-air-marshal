### Spam/Bot Invasion Protection System 
Spam/Bot prevention system allows community owners to protect their members from media messages which were not 
approved by the guilds staff members. Owner set ups the landing channel for all new members, and specifies the message
user needs to react with "thumbs up" emoji in order to get verified. When user joins "Unverified" role is assigned 
which, upon appropriate reaction to message, is replaced by Verified.

### Jail System 
Why ban or kick members who breach the rules of the community, where you could just jail them for N amount of time and
give them a lesson??? This can be achieved with one command and Virtual Air Marshal will do the rest for you.
When member gets jailed, he will receive role "Jailed" where his rights and previous roles will be stripped. 
Virtual Air Marshal will than monitor for expiration, and once sentence passed, will automatically release user 
and re-assign previous roles member had on the guild.
